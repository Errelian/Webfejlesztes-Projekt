# Webfejlesztes-Projekt
My project for my web developement class.

Built in Java Spring.

Uses spring security and a h2 in-memory database.

Uses React as the frontend.

Use mvn spring-boot:run to run, it will make sure both the frontend and the backend are properly set up, so it may take some time.
